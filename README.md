# Installation

Okay so you want to install it right? 

So the first step is make sure you have GoLang on your operating system. 
I think that is pretty self explanatory [here](https://go.dev/)

Second, get all dependencies. Run these commands if you trust it.
1. `go get github.com/golang/freetype`
1. `go get github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2`
- If the above fails you need to install a C compiler or your operating system specific dependencies. Go [here](https://ebiten.org/documents/install.html) for more info.

If everything is good run this command
1. `go run .`

# Testing

Wow! Can you believe I have unit tests. Do not ask about code coverage!

Running tests
1. `go test ./...`

# Installation Failed

Okay so the installation failed. Well that's too bad. The only thing I can say is to pack up your bags and 
try again tomorrow. Who knows, maybe it will work!

Just open an issue if it doesn't work and MAYBE I will respond.

# Future Development

Look, this is a steaming pile of garbage. It's gonna be HUGE revamp if I work on this again. But, no, I don't think I will work on this any further.
